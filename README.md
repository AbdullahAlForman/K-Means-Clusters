# K-Means Customer Segmentation

## Overview  
This project applies the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to perform customer segmentation, a key task in marketing and data analytics. By grouping customers with similar behaviors, businesses can develop targeted strategies to improve engagement, increase sales, and personalize experiences.

## Objectives  
- Group customers based on their purchasing patterns.  
- Identify actionable insights for marketing and business decisions.  
- Demonstrate the use of the K-Means algorithm with practical data.

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalization, and scaling to prepare the data for clustering.  
- **Optimal Clusters:** Uses methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the ideal number of clusters.  
- **Visualization:** Provides insightful visualizations of customer clusters for better understanding.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Helps businesses create strategies tailored to specific customer groups.

## Installation  
To run this project, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then install the required libraries using the following command:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/K-Means-Customer-Segmentation.git
   cd K-Means-Customer-Segmentation
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook K-Means-Customer-Seg.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize the clusters.

## Example Output
